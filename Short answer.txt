Short answer:
Yeah, if you want other devs to seriously tinker with your stuff, you should put the code somewhere like GitHub and link to it from your site.

But there are a couple of important details you’ll want to get right, otherwise nobody will touch it.

1. What you actually need (conceptually)

To invite devs to play with your creations, you want three things:

Public repo

Your code lives in a public GitHub repository (or multiple, one per project).

Anyone can clone/download it.

Clear rules (license)

You explicitly state what people are allowed to do with the code.

Typical choice for “do what you want, just don’t blame me” is MIT License.

Without a license, technically no one is legally allowed to reuse your code, even if it’s on GitHub.

Obvious links & instructions

From your website, clear “For Developers” / “Source Code” links to the repos.

In each repo, a README explaining:

What the project is

How to run it

What they’re allowed to do (license)

How to contribute (if you want that)

That’s the “dev-friendly” setup.

2. Is GitHub strictly required?

No, in theory you could:

Offer zip downloads directly from your site.

Paste code in things like CodePen / JSFiddle, etc.

…but:

GitHub is what devs expect.

It has issues, pull requests, version history, etc.

It makes you look like you know what you’re doing, even if you don’t yet.

So: use GitHub. It’s the standard.

3. Practical roadmap for you (beginner-friendly)

I’ll keep this as a high-level checklist; if you want, we can go through each step one-by-one in detail later.

Step 1 – Set up GitHub

Create an account at github.com (username like JayLabs if available).

Once logged in, click New repository:

Name: e.g. jaylabs-playground

Visibility: Public

Tick “Add a README” (so the repo isn’t empty)

Create repository

Step 2 – Put your existing site code into GitHub

Because you’re already using VS Code, the long-term clean way is:

Install Git on your PC (if you haven’t already).

In VS Code, open your website folder.

Use the built-in Source Control to:

Initialize a Git repo

Commit your files

Push to the GitHub repo you just created

This sounds like a lot, but once it’s set up, updating is literally:

Change code → Commit → Push → done.

(If you want, we can do this as a strict step-by-step “click this, then this” walkthrough.)

Step 3 – Add a license

On GitHub, open your repo.

Click Add file → Create new file.

Name it LICENSE.

Choose a license template: MIT License is usually what you want.

Save/commit.

That’s the bit that tells people:

You’re allowed to fork, modify, reuse, etc., under these terms.

4. Make it obvious from your website

On your website, add something like to your footer or a “For Developers” section:

<footer>
  <p>Built by JayLabs. 
    <a href="https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      View source on GitHub
    </a>
  </p>
</footer>


And maybe a short dev-friendly line somewhere:

Developers: feel free to fork, remix, and break everything. See the GitHub repo for source code and license.

5. Optional but smart: invite contributions

In each repo’s README.md, add a short “Contributing” bit, e.g.:

“Open an issue if you find a bug.”

“Submit a pull request if you add something cool.”

“If you use this in your own project, a shout-out is appreciated but not required.”

That’s enough for devs to know you want them to mess with it.

If you like, next thing we can do is Step-by-step: get your current local website folder into a new GitHub repo, assuming nothing installed and zero Git knowledge.
